<h2> Automatic Pet Feeder </h2>
<p> Abstract </p>
<p> A motorized pet food feeder having a food storage bin with a top and a bottom, the bottom having an opening. A bowl with a back, front, and a bottom is provided which has a housing extending from the back of the bowl. The housing is adapted to removably receive the bottom of the food storage bin. A motor is mounted to the housing that has a rotatable shaft, and an auger is mounted to the rotatable shaft so that its free end extends substantially to above the back of the bowl. A tube is mounted to the housing and encloses the auger, the tube having an open end, coinciding with the free end of the auger and a portion of the tube being cut away to expose from above less than the full diameter of the auger. The cut away portion of the tube is aligned with the opening in the bottom of the food storage bin so that gravity feeds pet food from the food storage bin through the cut-away opening in the tube to the auger which, when rotating, moves the food out the open end of the tube into the bowl. 
In a preferred embodiment, the tube is cut away to expose from above approximately one-half the diameter of the auger and to expose from the side substantially the entire diameter of the auger. The pet food feeder is adapted to be used with various timing and sensing devices that control the actuation of the motor and the duration of activation, thereby controlling the amount of food transported by the auger to the bowl. </p>
